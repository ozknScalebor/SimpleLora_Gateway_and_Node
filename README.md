# SimpleLora
Simple Lora Gateway and Node(Sends Temp and Hum.) Example

# 1. Introduction
This page describes our low-cost simple LoRa gateway based on a Raspberry PI and Lora node based on a Ardunio nano. The gateway can receive messages from any LoRa device. This project is simple communication with lora. Ardunio Nodes send to temparature and humidity values to gateway. I used RadioHead library on ardunio and added to SHT21 communication codes.
